## Lemon Drop Hi-Res audio source code
Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res v123.1<br>
Also need the build.prop tweaks for Hardware Offloaded Audio Processing.<br>

The diff directory I uploaded the original, then uploaded the modded v122.1 that way you can look at the commits.<br>

I am still working on Lemon Drop Hi-Res for the most part I am adding the final touches, that's why I uploaded to GitHub.<br>

My hope is to have people add this code to other Android phones, so everyone can experience what Hi-Res audio sounds like on there phone.<br>

Why did I make Lemon Drop Hi-Res? I wanted a Hi-Res music player, but I didn't want to pay $2000.<br>
I knew that the Lgv20 had the best DAC for 2016 Saber ESS 9218 DAC.<br>
