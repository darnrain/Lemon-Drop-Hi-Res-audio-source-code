# Lemon-Drop-Hi-Res-audio-source-code
Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res rom Lgv20 v121.3
Also need the build.prop tweaks to make everthing work

The diff directory I uploaded the original, then uploaded the modded v122.1 that way you can look at the commits.

I am still working on Lemon Drop Hi-Res for the most part I am adding the final touches, that's why I uploaded to GitHub.

My hope is to have people add this code to other Android phones, so everyone can experiance what Hi-Res audio sounds like on there phone.

Why did I make Lemon Drop Hi-Res? I wanted a Hi-Res music player, but I didn't want to pay $2000.
