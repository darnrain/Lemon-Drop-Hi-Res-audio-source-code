## Lemon Drop Hi-Res audio source code
Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res v124.3<br>
Also need the build.prop tweaks for Hardware Offloaded Audio Processing.<br>

How long did it take me? The build.prop tweaks been working on them on and off for a year, and programing the mixer_paths file for two months, or longer I lost track of time.<br>

The diff directory I uploaded the original then the modded v122.1, that way you can look at the commits from gound zero.<br>

I am just about finished with Lemon Drop Hi-Res, just adding the final touches. That's why I uploaded to GitHub at this time.<br>

My hope is to have people add this code to other Android phones, so everyone can experience what Hi-Res audio sounds like on there phone.<br>

Why did I make Lemon Drop Hi-Res? I wanted a Hi-Res music player, but I didn't want to pay $2000.<br>
I knew that the Lgv20 had the best QuadDAC for 2016 Saber ESS 9218 DAC.<br>
