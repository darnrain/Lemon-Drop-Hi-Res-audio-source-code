## Lemon Drop Hi-Res audio source code

### Welcome to the future of music...
### The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.
### Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.
### With all 4 DACs enabled.
### A total of 8 channels in true stereo.

Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res v124.3<br>
Also need the build.prop tweaks for Hardware Offloaded Audio Processing.<br>

If you find an error or a mistake I made in the mixer_paths file, please open an issue and let me know so it can be fixed, thank you. with over 6000 lines of code chance of an error or a mistake is high.<br>

The diff directory I uploaded the original then the modded v122.1, that way you can look at the commits from gound zero.<br>

I am just about finished with Lemon Drop Hi-Res, just adding the final touches. That's why I uploaded to GitHub at this time.<br>

My hope is to have people add this code to Android roms, so everyone can experience what the future of music sounds like...<br>

Why did I make Lemon Drop Hi-Res? I wanted a Hi-Res music player, but I didn't want to pay $2000.<br>
I knew that the Lgv20 had the best QuadDAC for 2016 Saber ESS 9218 DAC.<br>
