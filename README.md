## Lemon Drop Hi-Res audio source code

Welcome to the future of music...<br>
The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.<br>
Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.<br>
With all 4 DACs enabled.<br>
A total of 98,304  channels in true stereo.<br>

Please listen at a safe volume level.<br>

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development status: Taking a break, v168.1 is unequivocally flawless.<br>
latest release: v168.1<br>

### Introduction:
If you all were wondering why I left XDA, I will tell you. It's because these LineageOS devs were telling people that "I suck at programing and do not use Lemon Drop HI-Res, it will drain your battery", saying everything they can to try and discourage people from using Lemon Drop Hi-Res. It actually doesn't bother me one bit, if not a single person out there wants to use Lemon Drop Hi-Res, I did entirely everything for me and me alone. I absolutely love my Lgv20 and I don't plan on ever buying a new phone ever! I get enjoyment sharing with people, that's just who I am. Well I guess they found me again, I keep getting emails from comments on GitHub, telling me to "Please stop lying to people.". What does that even mean? They could be a little more descriptive in what they are attempting to convey. Why would I lie to people about programing a QuadDAC? The 8,000 lines of code that I programed, is in the mixer_paths_tasha.xml.modded file for everyone to see. Who knows, maybe they genuinely think I am trying to cause harm to peoples phones? That is absolutely not true. I just wanted to have a little fun programing a QuadDAC and increasing the audio quality on my Lgv20. After thinking about that last statement, that does sound kinda odd. I mean who even attempts to program a QuadDAC in there spare time? Furthermore is it even possible to program the QuadDAC on the Lgv20? Haha the answer is yes, if your good at programing code, math and you enjoy a good challenge. My 34 years of computer experience helps also. I suppose some people do have a hidden agenda, mine would be, I wanted to show off my advanced computer skills, and I wanted to own one of the only cell phones, that has the absolute best audio quality out of any cell phone in the entire world.

As of a direct result of the harassment from the LineageOS devs, no one can open an issue or leave a comment on any of my projects on GitHub. It only takes a few bad apples to spoil the entire batch.<br>

### How did you find this True Native Mode code?
If your curious on how I found the True Native Mode code, I will show you. Someone left about 0.5% of the code in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file for the Lgv20. Go to line number 278 through 287 you will see the 0.5% of the True Native Mode code that I found. As you can see, INI1 HPHL, INI2 HPHR, INI7 SPKRL, INI8 SPKRR, INI3 LO1, INI4 LO2, INI5 LO3, INI6 LO4, lines of code are partially there, the absolute perfect base starting point for me, to create the True Native Mode code. LO1 even started with INI3 that gave me a clue. The other 99.5% I made with my own hands, all by myself. With trial and error and logic and my advanced Linux computer skills, if the code does not exist, make it yourself. No external resource was utilized, to my knowledge there is no  external resource of this nature. If you want to confirm that this original mixer_paths_tasha.xml is authentic, I will give you the link to the Lgv20 rom that has this 0.5% True Native Mode code.<br> https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=1322778262904012823

### How did you transform the Lgv20 into A Professional High Resolution Audio Player?
For those that don't know, the mixer_paths_tasha.xml file is how you program the, Saber ESS 9128 DAC. I have always known that the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file, was messed up and things were out of the correct order. So with trial, error, logic, and my advanced Linux computer skills and the knowledge of knowing that things were messed up and out of the correct order in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file, is how I have successfully transformed my Lgv20 into a Professional High Resolution Audio Player.<br>

### What is True Native Mode on a computer?
"(1) The normal running mode of a computer, executing programs from its built-in instruction set. Contrast with emulation mode. See native language. (2) The highest performance state of a computer."<br>

### What is True Native Mode on the Saber ESS 9218 DAC?<br>
I created all 1568 lines of the True Native Mode code myself, with the help of echo and nano, there are 786 mixer paths for True Native Mode that places the QuadDAC into it's highest performance state. The very essence of True Native Mode it's self allows the DAC to have more than two channels, like one for left and one for right. I have the QuadDAC overclocked so we can have more than 3072 channels. There are 768 channels going to each DAC, 768 X 64 = 49152 then divide 49152 by 2 = 24576 for each DAC for a total of 98304 channels. We can only hear up to 20kHz however the more channels there are the better the audio sounds to us, it's like SD video vs HD video.<br>

### How did you program and tune the QuadDAC?
When programing a QuadDAC you do not have visual gauges to view to see if you have done something wrong, its all done by the sound of the DAC. For example if you have increased the amount of channels way to high or messed up on your programing code, then the DACs volume will be decreased or the music will not sound like its full of life. The only way to accomplish that, is to lower the AVC volume. In other words it decreases the power to the DAC so you can program and tune the DAC. In v142.1 and higher the AVC volume is set to the maximum. I know with out a doute that the True Native Mode code is pristine, I had echo print out the numbers, then I cut and pasted 768 times. I used nano's macro feature to program True Native Mode.<br>

I guess you could say I have a gift that allows me to think outside of the box. I was always seeing LO in the True Native Mode code. I was like what is LO??? Then it hit me it's the bass. I came up with MI and HI for mid-range and treble myself and it worked!!! Also I was always seeing RX everywhere I looked, I was like well if there is an RX there has to be a TX. I guess you could say it was trial, error, logic and my advanced Linux computer skills, is how I programed the Saber ESS 9218 DAC. The devs that programed the Saber ESS DAC chip are professionals, you need to think like how they think. They would not make it to complicated to program the QuadDAC. To me it was the ultimate puzzle that needed to be solved and I did solve it. It feels good.<br>

### I want to add this True Native Mode code, to my Android phone?
It is my understanding that the two files responsible for making this all happen are, audio_platform_info.xml and mixer_paths_tasha.xml. This is only a theory, I am 99.9% positive, that you only need to mod those two files. If the QuadDAC was going through the Android mixer, then the audio would be down sampled. I have disconnected the DAC from the Android mixer in file audio_platform_info.xml so itâ€™s outputting directly to wired headphones at 32bit 352.8kHz. That is why I think you only need to mod those two files. All the other files are associated with the Android mixer and are the left over reminisce of my previous attempts of trying to increase the audio quality on the Lgv20 without avail. Duplicate all the changes I made leaving intact your unique settings in your mixer_paths.xml file. This will take you some time, it took me months upon months to program all that code in the mixer_paths file. I made notes in both files, to help you along the way. This is not for the novice computer user. The mixer_paths file must have zero typos, zero mistakes, zero errors. The QuadDAC also needs Enable System wide QuadDAC support v8.2 aka build.prop audio tweaks.<br>

When programing the mixer_paths file, I only use the tab key not the spacebar, it's just a pet peeve. ;)<br>

I cant program with how disorganized the original mixer_paths file is. This is how I tabbed all lines and fixed it. I use arch linux.<br>

Example:
<pre>
cat your_mixer_paths_file.xml | sed 's/^[ \t]*//' > new_mixer_paths_file.xml
</pre>

sed commands:<br>
Move all lines to the left.<br>
<pre>
sed 's/^[ \t]*//'
</pre>
Tab all lines.<br>
<pre>
 sed 's/^/\t/'
</pre>
### Will this True Native Mode code work on other Android phones other than the Lgv20?
Short answer, yes. As long as your phone has a Saber ESS QuadDAC.

### What do I need to set my Hi-Res music player at?
You need to choose 24bit 44.1kHz as the source, that's how I programed the DAC, it takes a 44.1kHz audio signal and upsamples the audio eight times to 32bit 352.8kHz. On wired headphones the output is 32bit 352.8kHz, all other devices the output is 44.1kHz 24bit or 16bit. If set to anything other than, 44.1kHz the audio does not get upsampled eight times or it does not multiply evenly into 352.8kHz. In other words, your not going to get the absolute best audio quality.<br>
 
### A little backstory.
I remember when I first found the True Native Mode code, I was like ooh what's that. Then I looked up online what True Native Mode was, the highest performance state of a computer, I was like cool. They left about 0.5% of the True Native Mode code in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file, I put the other 99.5% of the True Native Mode code together myself. Just think if they would have never left that small peace of code in the original mixer_paths_tasha.xml file this would have never had happened. Even more strange is that the 0.5% of the code I found, had the headphone side and the DAC side even the mixer paths, in other words everything was there to recreate the True Native Mode code. Almost like someone left it there deliberately? Another thing that is odd, is why would they put a Saber DAC chip in a phone that accepts the True Native Mode code programing? Why not just disable that on the chip it's self? All these unanswered questions, I guess we will never know. It's like if someone gave you the secret formula to make GOLD, wouldn't the first thing on your mind be, let's make some GOLD!!!<br>

Most likely they have a computer program that programs the QuadDAC for True Native Mode, me on the other hand, this True Native Mode code was all hand made by me. So in other words, the Lgv20 will sound like no other Hi-Res music player in the world. A computer program cannot replace the very essence, of what a human is able to accomplish when programing a QuadDAC.<br>
