Lemon Drop Hi-Res development status: Active.<br>
latest release: v138.1<br>

Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res<br>
Enable System wide QuadDAC support v8.2 aka build.prop audio tweaks.<br>
They both go hand and hand to increase the audio quality of the QuadDAC to the maximum.<br>

If you find an error or a mistake I made in the mixer_paths file, please open an issue and let me know so it can be fixed, thank you. with over 6000 lines of code chance of an error or a mistake is high.<br>

The diff directory I uploaded the original then the modded v122.1, that way you can look at the commits from gound zero.<br>

My hope is to have people add this code to Android roms, so everyone can experience what the future of music sounds like...<br>

Why did I make Lemon Drop Hi-Res? I wanted a Hi-Res music player, but I didn't want to pay $2000.<br>
I knew that the Lgv20 had the best QuadDAC for 2016 Saber ESS 9218 DAC.<br>
