## Lemon Drop Hi-Res audio source code

### Welcome to the future of music...
### The Lgv20 was first with the Android Nougat operating system.
### Now it's the first running in True Native Mode.
### With all 4 DACs enabled.
### A total of 98,304  channels in true stereo.

Lemon Drop Hi-Res development status: Active.<br>
latest release: v143.2<br>

Audio souce code for Lemon Drop Hi-Res<br>
Enable System wide QuadDAC support v8.2 aka build.prop audio tweaks.<br>
They both go hand and hand to increase the audio quality of the QuadDAC to the maximum.<br>

The diff directory I uploaded the original then the modded v122.1, that way you can look at the commits from gound zero.<br>

They left about 0.5% of the True Native Mode code in the mixer_paths file, I put the other 99.5% of the True Native Mode together myself. Just think if they would have never left that small peace of code in the mixer_paths file this would have never had happened. All I can say is that must have been a mistake, the Lgv60 does not have that small peace of code, only the Lgv20 does. I bet this is the same True Native Mode code as a $2000 Hi-Res music player. Most likely they have a computer program that programs the QuadDAC for True Native Mode, me on the other hand, this True Native Mode code was all hand made by me. So in other words, the Lgv20 will sound like no other Hi-Res music player in the world. A computer program cannot replace the very essence, of what a human is able to accomplish when programing a QuadDAC.<br>

My hope is to have people add this code to other Android roms, so everyone can experience what the future of music sounds like...<br>
